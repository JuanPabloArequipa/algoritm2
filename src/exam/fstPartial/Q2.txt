Q2:If we can solve a problem by combining the solutions to its sub-problems, does that mean that we can solve it with
a DP algorithm?

Answer: No, because the most important thing to apply DP is that we can reuse the already calculated values, it is
not only to divide the problem into sub-problems, it is needed that occurs an overlapping in sub-problems
