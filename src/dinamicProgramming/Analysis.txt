1. Identify if this problem can be solved with dynamic programming and/or a greedy algorithm
The problem can be solved with a greedy algorithm.

i. Greedy choice:
Always choose the largest possible size to divide the chocolate bar, starting from size 1 and incrementing it until it's no longer possible to divide the remaining part of the bar.

ii. Optimal substructure:
The optimal solution for dividing the chocolate bar of size N can be obtained by considering the optimal solutions for dividing smaller sub-bars of size N-1, N-2, N-3, until the size is lower than N.
OptimalSolution(Global) = pieces(N-1)...pieces(N-size)

iv. Time complexity:
O(N), where N is the length of the chocolate bar.
